## Project Summary
A bank customer churn analysis was conducted using a dataset provided by Bank. All 7 tables were loaded into MYSQL and the analysis was performed in MYSQL and created PowerBI dashboard for visualizations. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, and useful insights were derived. Recommendations were then made to reduce customer churn. The analysis revealed that incentives need to be offered to customers who are at risk of churning, such as discounts, additional benefits, or personalized outreach. This includes customers with Fair or Poor credit scores, inactive customers, customers with credit cards, customers in Spain, Germany or France, customers who only use one product, customers whose tenure of 1 year.

## Recommendations:

1. The analysis highlights the need for the bank to focus on retaining its established and long-term customers in all income categories. especially female card holders based in Germany.
2. Targeted marketing ad campaigns should be used to effectively reach the customer segments contributing the most to churn. Examples of such campaigns include:
3. Partnering with brands that appeal to the target audience (e.g partnering with fitness brands and offering discounts on gym memberships or workout gears to male and female graduates who are married or single)
4. Providing personalized investment advice and retirement planning services to established and long-term customers, which could help them maximize their savings and achieve their long-term financial goals.
